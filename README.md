# 🧠 Story Generator using Generative AI

This project is a Story Generator built using Generative AI models like GPT-2. It allows users to enter a sentence or a phrase, and the system generates a creative continuation of the story. This tool showcases how transformer-based language models can be used for creative writing and storytelling tasks.

## 📌 Project Overview

This application takes user input as the start of a story and generates a plausible and imaginative continuation using a pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. A simple and intuitive web interface is provided using Streamlit.

## 🔍 Features

- Generate short story continuations from user input.
- Display multiple generated story versions.
- Web-based interface with Streamlit.
- Lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user enters a prompt (first line or paragraph).
2. The GPT-2 model processes the prompt.
3. The model generates creative story continuations.
4. The results are displayed in real time on the interface.
